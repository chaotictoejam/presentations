# “How Computers Think” (Elementary Version)

## Slide 1 — Title
Today I’m going to teach you how computers think, or try to think!

## Slide 2 - Who I am
Software Engineer
Works with AI + coding
Builds tools that help people

## Slide 3 - What is a computer?
 (Talk about different "types" of computers (phones, tablets, laptops, smart watches)
A computer is essentially a machine that follows instructions with precision. It only does what we tell it to do. 
But here's an interesting question: can computers do more? Can they learn independently, just like you learn new things at school?
This sets the stage for exploring the world of artificial intelligence, where machines might begin to think and learn in ways we once thought impossible. 

## Slide 4 - What is AI?
Define artificial (this is a new word to most students)

## Slide 5 - Can Computers Think Like Humans?
Computers don’t feel or think like us.
They just follow patterns and rules we teach them.

## Slide 6 - Learning

# ACTIVITY 1 SECTION — “Guess What the AI Sees”
## Slide 7 - Guess What the AI Sees
We’re going to play a game called Guess What the AI Sees!

## Slide 8 — Example Photo 1

Visual: Photo of cat
Prompt text: “What do YOU see?”

Say:

“How do you know this is a cat?
What clues do you use?”

##  Slide 9 — Example Photo 2

Visual: Photo of dog
Prompt: “How do we tell the difference?”

Say:

“Computers learn the same clues — ears, shapes, colors.”

##  Slide 10 — How AI Learns

A computer doesn’t know what a cat or a dog is. It doesn’t have a brain.
But if we show it thousands of photos…”

…the computer begins to notice patterns.
It sees shapes, colors, ears, tails — and slowly learns the differences!”

We call this training the AI.

##  Slide 11 — Example Photo 2

It's a dog, but AI thinks this is a cat. Why?

# ACTIVITY 2 SECTION — “Be The AI!”

## Slide 12 — Round 1

Say:

“Here are two examples.
Can you guess the rule? What goes together?”

They might guess:

“Circles and squares!”

“Red and blue!”

“Colors go together!”

“Shapes go together!”

No matter what they say, respond:

Say:

“Good guesses! But the AI doesn’t know yet. It needs more examples.”

## Slide 13 — Round 2

Ask:

“Now what pattern do you think the AI is learning?”

Students usually discover:

“Red goes with red!”

“Blue goes with blue!”

“Circles go together!”

“Squares go together!”

If they mix it up, that’s GOOD.

Say:

“Exactly!
You needed more examples to learn the rule. Just like an AI needs lots of data.”

## Slide 14 — Round 3

WHAT YOU SAY

“Now you’re the AI… but here’s something you’ve never seen before!”

Hold up the purple circle.
Ask:

“What do you think this is?
And what do you think the AI would guess?”

They will shout guesses.

Then explain:

“This is where AI gets confused!
If the AI has never seen purple before, it will guess based on the patterns it knows — and it might be wrong.”

AI only knows what we teach it.

AI can get confused with new or unusual data.

This is why AI sometimes makes mistakes!

# Wrap Up

## Slide 15 - Do computers actually think like us? (Recap)

“Do computers actually think like us?”
Let them answer, then summarize:
No! Computers don’t really think or feel. They just follow patterns and learn from examples we give them. 
Engineers like me help them learn safely and do useful things — like helping doctors, making video games, or teaching robots to help people.

## Slide 16 — What AI Is Good At

AI helps with games, robots, maps, and more!

## Slide 17 — Why AI Makes Mistakes

AI messes up when it hasn’t seen something before.

## Slide 18 — You Can Be an AI Teacher!

You can teach computers someday, just like I do!
